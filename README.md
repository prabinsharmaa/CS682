In order to read from and write data to Google Sheets in Python, we will have to create a Service Account. I have taken reference from the link https://blog.coupler.io/python-to-google-sheets/ . According to google cloud docs, "A service account is a special kind of account used by an application or a virtual machine (VM) instance, not a person. Applications use service accounts to make authorized API calls, authorized as either the service account itself or as Google Workspace or Cloud Identity users through domain-wide delegation."

#Creating a service account
1. Go to [Google developer console] (https://console.cloud.google.com/) and click on **Create Project**
2. 
3.
